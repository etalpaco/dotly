SVR 2011 is the last installment of the SmackDown vs. Raw series that was released for PS2 in 2010. It has a similar engine and gameplay as WWE 12, but with different rosters, arenas, and modes. Fortunately, some talented modders have created a patch that transforms SVR 2011 into WWE 12, with updated wrestlers, attires, entrances, movesets, and more.
 
In this article, we will show you how to play WWE 12 on PS2 with SVR 2011 mod. You will need a modded PS2 or a PS2 emulator on your PC, a copy of SVR 2011 (either disc or ISO), and a USB flash drive or a DVD-R. Follow these steps to get started:
