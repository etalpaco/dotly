If you are looking for some extra fun and challenge in Call Of Duty Black Ops II, you might want to try using cheat codes. Cheat codes are special commands that can modify the game in various ways, such as giving you unlimited ammo, health, or money, unlocking all weapons and perks, or enabling god mode. However, cheat codes are not officially supported by the game developers, so you will need to use a third-party software called SKIDROW to enable them.
 
SKIDROW is a crack that allows you to play Call Of Duty Black Ops II without the original disc or online activation. It also comes with a cheat engine that lets you enter cheat codes in the game. To use SKIDROW, you will need to download and install the Update 1 and 2 patches for Call Of Duty Black Ops II, which are available on various torrent sites. After installing the patches, you will need to copy the contents of the SKIDROW folder to your game directory, replacing any existing files.

Once you have done that, you can launch the game from the SKIDROW.exe file. To enter cheat codes, you will need to press the tilde (~) key during gameplay to open the console. Then, you can type in any of the following cheat codes and press enter to activate them:
 
- god - Enables god mode (invincibility)
- noclip - Enables noclip mode (fly through walls)
- give all - Gives you all weapons and items
- sf\_use\_ignoreammo 1 - Gives you unlimited ammo
- player\_sustainammo 1 - Gives you unlimited grenades
- cg\_fov 90 - Changes your field of view to 90 degrees
- r\_fullbright 1 - Makes everything brighter
- cg\_drawfps 1 - Shows your frames per second

Note that cheat codes only work in single-player mode and may cause glitches or crashes. Also, using cheat codes may disable your achievements and leaderboards. Use them at your own risk and discretion.
  
Some of the cheat codes are also Easter eggs, which are hidden secrets or references that can be found in the game. For example, you can play some old Activision classics on the Nuketown 2025 map by shooting off the heads of all the mannequins within two minutes of starting a game[^1^] [^2^]. You can also see Thor's hammer in a cave in the Celerium mission[^1^], or watch Jimmy Kimmel on TV in the prison cell of Raul Menendez[^1^]. These Easter eggs add some humor and nostalgia to the game.
 
Besides cheat codes and Easter eggs, there are also some permanent perks that you can unlock in the zombies mode. These perks are saved to your profile and will remain active even if you die or restart the game. For example, you can unlock permanent Deadshot Daquiri by getting a collateral headshot with one bullet[^2^], which will increase your headshot multiplier. You can also unlock permanent Juggernog by downing yourself twice with quick revive in solo mode[^2^], which will increase your health. These perks can help you survive longer and kill more zombies.
 
Call Of Duty Black Ops II is a game that offers a lot of variety and customization for players who want to experiment with different modes, weapons, and settings. By using cheat codes, you can modify the game to your liking and have some fun with it. However, you should also be aware of the risks and consequences of using cheat codes, such as glitches, crashes, or disabled features. Use them at your own risk and discretion.
