## How to Choose and Edit a Template
 
One of the easiest ways to make a 3D intro video with BluffTitler is to use one of the templates that come with the app. You can find them in the File > Open show... menu or by clicking on the folder icon on the toolbar. You can browse through different categories of templates, such as BixPack, Community, Titles, Lower Thirds, Bumpers and more. You can also download free intro videos from the community[^1^] or buy professional intros from BixPack[^1^], the BluffTitler template store.
 
To open a template, simply double-click on it or select it and click on the Open button. The template will load in the main window of BluffTitler, where you can see a preview of the video. You can play, pause, rewind and fast-forward the video using the buttons on the toolbar or the keyboard shortcuts.
 
To edit a template, you need to select a layer from the layer list on the right side of the window. A layer is a basic element of a video, such as text, picture, model, camera or light. Each layer has its own properties that you can change in the Layer > Active layer properties... menu or by clicking on the gear icon on the toolbar. You can also add new layers or delete existing ones using the buttons on the toolbar or the Layer menu.
 
For example, if you want to change the text of a title layer, you need to select it from the layer list and then change its Text property in the active layer properties dialog. You can also change other properties of the text layer, such as font, size, color, bevels, effects and more. You can see how your changes affect the video in real time in the preview window.
