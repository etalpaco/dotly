The game features a single-player campaign that takes players to various locations around the world, such as Bosnia, Pakistan, Philippines and Somalia, where they have to face real-world threats and terrorist groups. The game also features a multiplayer mode that allows players to choose from 12 different Tier 1 units and customize their weapons and appearance. The game uses the Frostbite 2 engine, which provides realistic graphics and physics, as well as dynamic door breaches and micro-destruction.
 
Medal Of Honor Warfighter Spolsz received mixed reviews from critics and players alike. Some praised the game's graphics, sound effects, and authenticity, while others criticized the game's story, gameplay, and technical issues. The game was also controversial for its depiction of real-world events and locations, such as the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound and the use of a nuclear bomb in Yemen. The game was banned in Pakistan for portraying the country negatively.
 
Despite the mixed reception, Medal Of Honor Warfighter Spolsz sold well in Poland, where it was one of the best-selling games of 2012. The game also received several updates and DLCs, such as the Zero Dark Thirty Map Pack and the Global Warfighter Shortcut Pack. The game is still played by many Polish fans who enjoy the realistic and gritty action of the Medal Of Honor series.
  
The gameplay of Medal Of Honor Warfighter Spolsz is similar to other modern military shooters, such as Call of Duty and Battlefield. The player controls a Tier 1 operator from a first-person perspective and uses various weapons and gadgets to complete objectives and eliminate enemies. The game features a cover system that allows the player to lean and peek around corners, as well as a slide mechanic that lets the player quickly move from one cover to another. The game also features a dynamic door breach system that lets the player choose how to enter a room, such as kicking the door, using a shotgun, or throwing a grenade.
 
The game's campaign consists of 13 missions that are based on real-world events and locations. The missions vary in length and difficulty, and often require the player to switch between different characters and units. The game also features cutscenes that show the personal lives and struggles of the main characters, such as Preacher's relationship with his wife and daughter. The game tries to balance the action and drama of the story, but some critics felt that the game failed to deliver a coherent and engaging narrative.
 
The game's multiplayer mode is one of the main attractions of Medal Of Honor Warfighter Spolsz. The multiplayer mode allows up to 20 players to compete in various game modes and maps that are inspired by real-world locations. The multiplayer mode also features a class system that lets the player choose from 12 different Tier 1 units from 10 different countries, such as Poland's GROM, Germany's KSK, and Canada's JTF2. Each unit has its own unique weapons, abilities, and appearance. The multiplayer mode also features a weapon customization system that lets the player modify their weapons with different optics, barrels, muzzles, receivers, magazines, and paint jobs.
