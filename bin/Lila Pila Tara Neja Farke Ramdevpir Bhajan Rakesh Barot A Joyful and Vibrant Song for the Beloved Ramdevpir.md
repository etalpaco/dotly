Sonic Charge Microtonic 3 (also known as ÂµTonic) is a VST/AU plug-in for Windows and Mac that features a unique drum and percussion synthesizer combined with a pattern-based drum-machine engine[^2^] [^6^]. You can use Microtonic as a sound module to play drum sounds from your MIDI keyboard or sequencer, or you can use the built-in pattern engine to play drum patterns in sync with your sequencer[^2^]. The sound of Microtonic is 100% synthetic and rendered in real-time. No samples or pre-rendered waveforms are used[^2^].
 
Microtonic has eight channel drum and percussion synthesizer with over-sampled oscillators and sample-accurate triggering[^2^]. Each channel has the same synthesis controls, which include an oscillator, a noise generator, a filter, an envelope, an LFO, a mixer, an EQ and a distortion unit[^4^]. You can create any type of electronic drum/cymbal sound with Microtonic, from classic analog sounds to futuristic glitches and noises[^4^]. Microtonic also comes bundled with loads of factory sounds and patterns, as well as additional content packages that you can download from the Sonic Charge website[^2^].

Microtonic has a simple and easy to use interface with context menus, popup hints and drag-and-drop functionality[^2^]. You can edit each channel individually or use the global controls to apply changes to all channels at once[^4^]. You can also use the morph slider to smoothly interpolate between two different settings for each channel[^2^]. Microtonic has plenty of creative editing options like smart alteration and randomization, which can generate new sounds and patterns based on your existing ones[^2^]. You can also use custom scripts to automate various tasks or add new features to Microtonic[^2^].
 
Microtonic has a familiar step sequencer with buttons for step, accent and fill[^4^]. The steps can represent values of eighth, 16th or 32nd-notes, with triplet values for the first two[^4^]. You can adjust the tempo, swing, shuffle and groove of the sequencer, as well as mute or solo individual channels[^4^]. You can also use the MIDI keyboard mode to trigger the channels from your MIDI controller or record your own patterns in real-time[^4^]. Microtonic can store up to 16 patterns per preset, which you can switch between using MIDI program change messages or the pattern selector buttons[^4^].
 
Microtonic is compatible with most DAWs that support VST or AU plug-ins. You can use it as an instrument or as an effect plug-in. You can also use it standalone with a virtual MIDI cable or a MIDI loopback device. Microtonic has extremely low CPU utilization, less than 5% on any low-end system[^2^]. It also supports multiple instances, automation and MIDI learn for all parameters[^2^].
