He delivers a performance that is both funny and touching, showing the different sides of Wonka's personality. Freddie Highmore is perfect as Charlie Bucket, the kind and humble boy who dreams of visiting the chocolate factory. He portrays Charlie with innocence and charm, making him easy to root for. The other children who win the golden tickets are also well-cast, each one representing a different vice or flaw that leads to their downfall.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is also a movie that explores some important themes and messages. One of them is the contrast between poverty and wealth, and how they affect people's happiness and morality. Charlie is poor but happy, because he has a loving family and a good heart. He is grateful for everything he has, even a simple chocolate bar. He does not envy or resent the rich children who have more than him. He is generous and honest, and does not cheat or lie to get what he wants. On the other hand, the other four children are rich but unhappy, because they are spoiled, selfish and greedy. They have everything they want, but they always want more. They do not appreciate or respect what they have, or the people around them. They are rude and dishonest, and they cheat and lie to get their way. The movie shows how wealth can corrupt people's character and values, and how poverty can inspire people's virtue and dignity.

Another theme that the movie explores is the idea of appearances can be deceiving. The movie challenges the stereotypes and expectations that people have based on how someone or something looks. Charlie's pitiful appearance belies his inner strength and ability to outlast the other children and eventually take control of the entire chocolate factory. Mr. Wonka's small size disguises his intense energy and amazing power. He has the power to determine children's fates and grant wishes. The chocolate factory itself looks old and abandoned from the outside, but inside it is a wonderland of innovation and creativity. The Oompa Loompas look identical and uniform, but they have different personalities and talents. The movie shows how people and things can surprise us if we look beyond their surface.
 
A third theme that the movie explores is the concept of nothing is impossible. The movie celebrates the power of imagination and invention, and how they can overcome any obstacle or limitation. Mr. Wonka is a genius who can create anything he dreams of, from everlasting gobstoppers to teleporting chocolate bars. He does not let anything stop him from pursuing his passion and vision. Charlie is a dreamer who believes that anything can happen, from finding a golden ticket to inheriting a chocolate factory. He does not let anything discourage him from following his heart and hope. The movie shows how imagination and invention can make life more exciting and fulfilling.
