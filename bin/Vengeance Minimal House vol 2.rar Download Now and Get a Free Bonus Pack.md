## Step 1: Choose your tempo and key
 
The first step is to choose your tempo and key for your track. Minimal house music usually has a tempo between 120 and 130 BPM (beats per minute), but you can experiment with different tempos depending on your mood and style. You can also choose any key you like, but some common keys for minimal house are C minor, F minor, G minor and A minor.
 
To set your tempo and key in your DAW, you can use the metronome and the tuner tools. You can also use a MIDI keyboard or a virtual keyboard to play some notes and chords to find the key that suits you best.
