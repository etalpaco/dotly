Then, you will see the configuration menu with several options. You can choose which drives you want to freeze, set a thawed period for updates and maintenance, enable or disable notifications and password protection, and more. You can also create a workstation seed file that allows you to deploy Deep Freeze to multiple PCs with the same serial number.
 
## Step 3: Activate Deep Freeze Standard
 
The final step is to activate Deep Freeze Standard on your PC. To do this, you need to reboot your PC and wait for the Deep Freeze icon to appear on the system tray. Then, right-click on the icon and select "Boot Frozen". This will freeze your hard drive and protect your PC from any unwanted changes.
 
To make changes to your system, you need to boot thawed by right-clicking on the icon and selecting "Boot Thawed". This will allow you to make temporary changes that will be erased after a reboot. You can also use the "ThawSpace" feature to create a virtual partition where you can save files that will not be affected by Deep Freeze.
