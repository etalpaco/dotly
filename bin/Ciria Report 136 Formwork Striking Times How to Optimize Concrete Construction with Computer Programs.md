Formwork striking times are an important factor in concrete construction, as they affect the speed, quality and safety of the project. Formwork striking times refer to the time when the formwork can be removed and the concrete can support itself without damage or collapse. However, determining the optimal formwork striking times is not a simple task, as it depends on various factors such as concrete strength, temperature, curing conditions, loading and structural design.
 
Fortunately, there is a comprehensive guide that can help engineers and contractors to estimate and reduce formwork striking times using reliable methods and criteria. This guide is called Ciria Report 136 Formwork Striking Times: Criteria, Prediction and Methods of Assessment[^1^] [^2^], and it was published by CIRIA (Construction Industry Research and Information Association) in 1995. This report supersedes the previous CIRIA Report 73 Formwork Striking Time - Methods of Assessment[^1^] [^4^], which was published in 1987.

In this article, we will summarize the main contents and benefits of Ciria Report 136, and explain how to use it for optimal formwork striking times.
  
## What is Ciria Report 136?
 
Ciria Report 136 is a state-of-the-art advice on formwork striking times, based on extensive research and practical experience. It covers the following topics:
 
- The criteria governing the striking of formwork, such as concrete strength, structural stability, durability and appearance.
- The methods for predicting formwork striking times using computer programs, such as maturity methods, equivalent age methods and empirical methods.
- The applications of these methods to different types of structures, such as beams, columns, slabs, walls and shells.
- The techniques for reducing formwork striking times where these are considered excessive, such as using high-strength concrete, admixtures, accelerators, heating or insulation.
- The methods for determining the actual formwork striking times on site, such as testing concrete strength, measuring temperature or maturity, or observing cracking or deflection.
- The advantages and weaknesses of each method and technique.

The report also includes two detailed appendices that provide a method for calculating the concrete strength required for a structure to withstand wind loading shortly after removal of formwork[^1^], and an example of the calculation of maturity using the Sadgrove formula[^1^].
