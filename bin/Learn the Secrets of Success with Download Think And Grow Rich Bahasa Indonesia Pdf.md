## What is .xf.adesk2012x64.20?
 
.xf.adesk2012x64.20 is an executable file that belongs to X-Force Keygen, a software tool that can generate serial numbers and activation codes for various Autodesk products. X-Force Keygen is not an official product of Autodesk, but rather a third-party program that is often used to bypass the activation process of Autodesk software.
 
.xf.adesk2012x64.20 is specifically designed for 64-bit versions of Autodesk products released in 2012, such as AutoCAD 2012, 3ds Max 2012, Maya 2012, Revit 2012 and so on. The file name indicates that it is a patch file that can modify the original files of Autodesk software to make them accept the generated serial numbers and activation codes.
 
## How to use .xf.adesk2012x64.20?
 
To use .xf.adesk2012x64.20, you need to have X-Force Keygen installed on your computer. You can download X-Force Keygen from various websites on the internet, but be careful as some of them may contain viruses or malware. You also need to have the Autodesk product that you want to activate installed on your computer.
 
Once you have both X-Force Keygen and the Autodesk product ready, you can follow these steps to use .xf.adesk2012x64.20:
 
1. Run X-Force Keygen as administrator and select the product that you want to activate from the drop-down menu.
2. Click on "Generate" to create a serial number and an activation code for your product.
3. Copy the serial number and paste it into the installation window of your Autodesk product when prompted.
4. Click on "Next" and select "I have an activation code from Autodesk".
5. Copy the activation code from X-Force Keygen and paste it into the activation window of your Autodesk product.
6. Click on "Next" and enjoy your activated Autodesk product.

## Is .xf.adesk2012x64.20 safe or a virus?
 
.xf.adesk2012x64.20 is not a virus, but it is not safe either. As mentioned earlier, .xf.adesk2012x64.20 is part of a keygen program that can generate serial numbers and activation codes for Autodesk products without paying for them. This means that using .xf.adesk2012x64.20 is illegal and violates the terms of service of Autodesk.
 
Using .xf.adesk2012x64.20 can also expose your computer to various risks, such as:
