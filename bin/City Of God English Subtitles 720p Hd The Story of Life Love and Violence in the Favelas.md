ModelSim-Altera 6.5b Quartus II 9.1 is a software package that allows you to perform functional and timing simulations of your FPGA designs using the Intel Quartus Prime software. In this article, we will show you how to set up and run a simulation using ModelSim-Altera 6.5b Quartus II 9.1.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install ModelSim-Altera 6.5b Quartus II 9.1
 
You can download ModelSim-Altera 6.5b Quartus II 9.1 from the Intel FPGA Download Center[^1^]. You will need to register and log in to access the download link. The file size is about 2 GB, so it may take some time to download depending on your internet connection speed.
 
**Download âœº [https://t.co/Ds2ZPWJF7x](https://t.co/Ds2ZPWJF7x)**


 
After downloading the file, run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You can choose the default installation options, or customize them according to your preferences. Make sure you install ModelSim-Altera 6.5b Quartus II 9.1 in the same directory as the Intel Quartus Prime software.
 
## Step 2: Create or Open a Project in Intel Quartus Prime
 
Launch the Intel Quartus Prime software and create a new project or open an existing one. You can use any of the supported FPGA devices and design entry methods, such as schematic, VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.
 
After creating or opening your project, you need to compile it by clicking on Processing > Start Compilation in the menu bar. This will generate the necessary files for simulation, such as the netlist, the SDC file, and the simulation libraries.
 
## Step 3: Launch ModelSim-Altera 6.5b Quartus II 9.1 from Intel Quartus Prime
 
To launch ModelSim-Altera 6.5b Quartus II 9.1 from Intel Quartus Prime, you can use one of the following methods:
 
- Click on Tools > Run Simulation Tool > RTL Simulation or Gate Level Simulation in the menu bar.
- Right-click on your project name in the Project Navigator window and select Run RTL Simulation or Run Gate Level Simulation.
- Use the NativeLink feature to run third-party tools from Intel Quartus Prime[^2^].

Depending on your choice, ModelSim-Altera 6.5b Quartus II 9.1 will open with either the RTL or the gate level netlist of your design loaded in the simulator.
 
## Step 4: Run and Debug Your Simulation in ModelSim-Altera 6.5b Quartus II 9.1
 
In ModelSim-Altera 6.5b Quartus II 9.1, you can use various commands and features to run and debug your simulation, such as:

- The vsim command to load and run a simulation.
- The add wave command to add signals to the waveform window.
- The force command to apply stimulus to your design inputs.
- The run command to advance the simulation time.
- The break command to set breakpoints in your code.
- The step command to execute one line of code at a time.
- The watch command to monitor changes in signal values.
- The probe command to display signal values in a pop-up window.
- The Tcl scripting feature to automate simulation tasks[^3^].

You can also use the graphical user interface (GUI) of ModelSim-Altera 6.5b Quartus II 9.1 to perform these tasks using buttons, menus, and dialogs.
