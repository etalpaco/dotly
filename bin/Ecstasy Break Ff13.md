## What is Ecstasy Break?
 
Ecstasy Break is a special ability that Lightning can use when she is in her Ravager role. It allows her to unleash a barrage of elemental attacks on a single target, dealing damage based on the target's elemental weaknesses. Ecstasy Break can hit up to 16 times, depending on how many elements the target is weak to. For example, if the target is weak to fire, ice, lightning, and water, Ecstasy Break will hit four times with each element, for a total of 16 hits.
  
Ecstasy Break is one of the most powerful abilities in the game, as it can deal over 99999 damage per hit if Lightning has high enough stats and equipment. However, Ecstasy Break also has some drawbacks. First of all, it consumes all of Lightning's ATB gauge, meaning she cannot perform any other actions until it recharges. Secondly, it can only be used once per battle, unless Lightning uses an Elixir or a Renew item to restore her ATB gauge. Thirdly, it can only target one enemy at a time, making it less effective against groups of enemies or enemies that are immune or resistant to elemental damage.
