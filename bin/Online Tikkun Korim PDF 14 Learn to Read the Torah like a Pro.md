# Online Tikkun Korim: A Convenient Tool for Torah Reading Practice
 
Tikkun Korim is a book that contains the text of the Torah in two columns: one with the vowels and cantillation marks, and one without them. The purpose of this book is to help people practice reading the Torah aloud with the correct pronunciation and melody. Tikkun Korim is traditionally used by those who are assigned to read a portion of the Torah in the synagogue, as well as by students and teachers of Torah.

However, not everyone has access to a physical copy of Tikkun Korim, or may find it inconvenient to carry around. That's why online versions of Tikkun Korim have been created, which allow users to access the text of the Torah on their computer or mobile device. One such online version is available at [Shafeh.org](https://www.shafeh.org/tikkun/), which offers a simple and user-friendly interface for choosing a parsha (weekly portion) from any of the five books of the Torah, including double portions. The online Tikkun Korim also has features such as zooming in and out, switching between columns, and changing the font size and color.
 
Another online version of Tikkun Korim is available at [HebrewBooks.org](https://hebrewbooks.org/50656), which provides a PDF file of an old-style Tikkun Korim, with 245 parallel columns according to the standard Ashkenazic tradition. The right column has been pasted from the popular edition published by Meir Letteris, and the left column shows a standard old scroll. The PDF file also contains haftarot (readings from the Prophets), the Scroll of Esther, laws about reading the Torah, and various prayers. An index is found on the final page.
 
Online Tikkun Korim can be a convenient tool for anyone who wants to practice reading the Torah or learn more about its text and structure. They can also be used as a supplement to physical copies of Tikkun Korim, or as an alternative when they are not available. Online Tikkun Korim can help users improve their proficiency and confidence in reading the Torah, as well as their appreciation and understanding of its content.
  
One of the benefits of online Tikkun Korim is that they can be accessed anytime and anywhere, as long as there is an internet connection. This means that users can practice reading the Torah at their own pace and convenience, without having to worry about finding a physical copy of Tikkun Korim or a Torah scroll. Online Tikkun Korim can also save users time and money, as they do not have to buy or borrow a book, or travel to a synagogue or library.
 
Another benefit of online Tikkun Korim is that they can enhance the learning experience of users, by providing them with different options and features. For example, users can choose between different editions and traditions of Tikkun Korim, depending on their preference and background. Users can also adjust the settings of the online Tikkun Korim to suit their needs and preferences, such as changing the font size and color, zooming in and out, switching between columns, and so on. Online Tikkun Korim can also provide users with additional resources and information, such as haftarot, laws, prayers, and indexes.
 
A third benefit of online Tikkun Korim is that they can foster a sense of community and connection among users, by allowing them to share their progress and feedback with others. For example, users can post their questions and comments on online forums or social media platforms, where they can receive support and guidance from other users or experts. Users can also join online groups or classes that use online Tikkun Korim as part of their curriculum or activities. Online Tikkun Korim can thus help users feel more engaged and motivated in their Torah reading practice.
