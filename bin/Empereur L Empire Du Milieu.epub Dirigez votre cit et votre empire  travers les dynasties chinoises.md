- Plan your city layout carefully. Make sure you have enough space for roads, farms, industries, monuments, and military buildings. Avoid building too close to the edges of the map, as you may need to expand later.
- Balance your economy. You need to produce enough food, goods, and money to satisfy your people and trade with other cities. You can adjust the tax rate, wages, and prices to control your income and expenses. You can also request or send gifts to other cities to improve your relations.
- Respect the Feng Shui. The Feng Shui is the harmony between the five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Each element has a positive or negative effect on certain buildings and activities. For example, wood enhances farming and education, but reduces metal production and military strength. You can use the Feng Shui overlay to see the elemental balance of your city.
- Worship the gods and ancestors. The gods and ancestors can grant you blessings or curses depending on your devotion. You can build temples, shrines, altars, and ancestral halls to honor them. You can also hold festivals and ceremonies to please them. Different gods and ancestors have different preferences and powers.
- Prepare for war. You may have to face enemies from within or outside China. You can build walls, towers, gates, and weapons to defend your city. You can also train soldiers, chariots, cavalry, and crossbowmen to attack your enemies. You can use spies to sabotage or infiltrate enemy cities.

Empereur: L'Empire du Milieu is a game that requires strategy, creativity, and patience. It is not an easy game, but it is a rewarding one. If you follow these tips and tricks, you may become a great emperor of China.
