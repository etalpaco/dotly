## What is a WinEdt Registration Key?
 
A WinEdt registration key is a unique code that you receive by email after purchasing a license for WinEdt. The license can be for individual or multi-user use, and it does not expire but is non-transferable and non-convertible. The license also determines the number of computers on which you can install and use WinEdt.
 
The cost of a WinEdt license depends on the type and quantity of licenses you need. You can find the tables of available licenses and their prices on the WinEdt website[^1^]. You can pay by credit card, PayPal, purchase order, cheque, money order, or bank transfer. Note that VAT or local taxes may apply depending on your location.
  
## How to Purchase a WinEdt Registration Key?
 
To purchase a WinEdt registration key, you need to visit the WinEdt web store[^1^], which is hosted by Digital River's MyCommerce/ShareIt! platform. There you can choose the license type and quantity you want, and fill in your personal and payment information. You can also enter your VAT ID if you are VAT exempt.
 
After you complete the order process, you will receive an email confirmation from MyCommerce/ShareIt! with your order number and invoice. You will also receive another email from WinEdt Team with your registration key and instructions on how to enter it in WinEdt.

## How to Install and Activate WinEdt?
 
To install and activate WinEdt, you need to download the setup file winedt11.exe from the WinEdt website[^2^]. This file is for Windows 11 and 10, and it will automatically integrate with MiKTeX or TeX Live if you have them installed. If not, you will need to install them separately before using WinEdt.
 
Once you have downloaded the setup file, run it as administrator and follow the installer wizard. You can choose the default options or customize them according to your preferences. For example, you can decide if you want WinEdt associated with TeX files or not. You can also create a portable installation by disabling user profile creation.
 
After the installation is completed, start WinEdt and go to Help -> Register WinEdt... There you can enter your registration key exactly as given in the email from WinEdt Team. Press OK and your copy of WinEdt will become licensed. You can also pin WinEdt to the taskbar for easy access.
 
Now you can enjoy using WinEdt for creating and editing your LaTeX and TeX documents. You can also customize WinEdt's preferences, options, menus, toolbars, macros, etc. according to your needs. For more information on how to use WinEdt, you can check the online documentation[^3^] or the FAQs on the website.
