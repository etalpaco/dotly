The movie then shifts to the present day, where Rajinikanth plays Lingaa, the grandson of Raja Lingeshwaran. He is a petty thief who lives in Chennai with his friends (Santhanam and Karunakaran). He is approached by Lakshmi (Anushka Shetty), a journalist and an activist, who wants him to come to Solaiyur, the village where his grandfather built the dam. She tells him that the dam is in danger of being demolished by a corrupt politician Nagabhushan (Jagapathi Babu), who wants to loot the gold hidden inside the temple near the dam. She also tells him that only he can open the temple, as he is the heir of Raja Lingeshwaran.
 
Lingaa initially refuses to go with Lakshmi, but later agrees after learning that he can inherit his grandfather's wealth. He travels to Solaiyur with his friends and meets Karunakaran (Vijayakumar), the village head and a loyal friend of Raja Lingeshwaran. He also learns about his grandfather's legacy and sacrifices from the villagers. He decides to save the dam and the temple from Nagabhushan and his goons. He also develops feelings for Lakshmi, who helps him in his mission.
 
How Lingaa succeeds in his mission and how he learns about his grandfather's past forms the rest of the story.
