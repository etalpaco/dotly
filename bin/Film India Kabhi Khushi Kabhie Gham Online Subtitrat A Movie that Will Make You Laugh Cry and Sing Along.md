Ten years later, Rohan returns home from boarding school. He is shocked to learn that Rahul is not his biological brother and that he was adopted by Yashvardhan and Nandini. He also learns about the circumstances that led to Rahul's estrangement from the family. He vows to reunite his family and bring back his brother. He secretly travels to London, where he meets Rahul, Anjali and Pooja. He pretends to be a stranger who needs a place to stay and befriends them. He also falls in love with Pooja, who reciprocates his feelings.
 
Meanwhile, Yashvardhan's mother Lajwanti, who is fond of Rahul, convinces him to invite Rohan for Diwali. Rohan accepts the invitation and brings Rahul, Anjali and Pooja along with him. He hopes that this will be an opportunity for reconciliation between Rahul and Yashvardhan. However, things do not go as planned as Yashvardhan still refuses to acknowledge Rahul and Anjali. He also insults Anjali's father, who had come to Delhi to meet his son-in-law.
 
Rahul decides to leave with Anjali and Pooja, but not before confronting his father and expressing his hurt and anger. He also reveals that he has a son named Krish, who is named after Yashvardhan's father. He tells Yashvardhan that he has failed as a father and a grandfather. He also tells Rohan that he loves him and thanks him for his efforts.
 
As Rahul and his family are about to leave, Nandini stops them and begs them to stay. She tells Yashvardhan that she cannot bear to lose her son again and that he has to accept him and his wife. She also tells him that he has been unfair to Rahul and Anjali and that he has forgotten the meaning of love. She reminds him of how he had married her against his own father's wishes and how he had supported her when she wanted to adopt Rahul.
 
Yashvardhan realizes his mistake and runs after Rahul. He apologizes to him and Anjali and embraces them. He also meets Krish and blesses him. He then reconciles with Anjali's father and invites him to stay with them. The Raichand family is finally reunited and celebrates Diwali together.
